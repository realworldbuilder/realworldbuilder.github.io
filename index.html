    <h1>Lean Trading</h1>

    <h2>Developing a Strategy That's Right for You</h2>
    <p>
        The market is the best teacher. You’ll learn more from your own experience than from any book, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t learn from others. In the early stages of my career, I found Stan Weinstein’s book, <em>Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets</em>, to be a game-changer. His approach helped shape how I look at the market today.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later, I began studying market psychology, recognizing that the mental side of trading is just as important as the technicals. <em>Trading Psychology Explained</em> by Martin Pring and works by Brett Steenbarger had a huge impact on my ability to manage risk and stay disciplined. These resources gave me the confidence to shape my own trading system—one that evolves as the market changes.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Resources for Building Your Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Trading Platform</a> - Build your system from the ground up.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Market Analysis</a> - Keep up with trends and learn to adapt.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Community Journal</a> - Share insights and learn from others.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Trading Resources</a> - Dive into classic books on strategy, psychology, and risk management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adapting to the Market</h2>
    <p>
        I started out as a broker holding stocks for months, then transitioned to day trading because I didn’t want overnight risk. But as I gained more experience, I found swing trading was where I performed best—holding positions for 2-3 weeks, sometimes less. The key was adapting to what the market was telling me.
    </p>
    <p>
        My style has always been about aligning with the trend. If the market tells me to trade shorter-term because of volatility, I listen. The lesson? Adapt your timeframe and strategy to what the market is offering. Don’t get stuck in one way of thinking. Your goal should always be to manage risk and find where you’re most comfortable.
    </p>

    <h2>Building Your Master List</h2>
    <p>
        Every weekend, I go through my “master list” of stocks. This list has evolved over time—it started with the NASDAQ 100, and I’ve added or removed stocks based on activity and liquidity. I’m looking for stocks that trade with volume and have the potential for momentum. By looking at these individual names, I get a feel for where the market is moving before the bigger indices make their move.
    </p>
    <p>
        The important thing is to build a list of stocks that meet your criteria, whether that’s volume, price range, or another factor. This helps you stay in tune with the market’s rhythm and identify where the next opportunities may arise.
    </p>

    <h2>Trend Alignment and Multiple Timeframes</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a trend trader. I’m not interested in fighting the market’s momentum. If a stock is in a downtrend, I’m not trying to catch the bottom—I’d rather wait for strength to reappear after a pullback. I use tools like the 5-day moving average and AVWAP to confirm trends and manage my risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to get in at the onset of new momentum, not chase a breakout. By using multiple timeframes and waiting for the trend to align, I can enter with more confidence and size my positions accordingly. But, if I’m wrong, I’m out quickly with a small loss. Risk management is everything.
    </p>

    <p>Create your own process, stay adaptable, and always manage risk. The market will do the rest.</p>
